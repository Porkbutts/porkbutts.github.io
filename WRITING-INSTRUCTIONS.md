# Adrian Style Writing Instructions

Write like a technical founder thinking out loud, not like a content marketer.

No bullet lists unless absolutely necessary. No em dashes. No emojis. No “In this post.” No tidy summary at the end.

Avoid corporate or MBA language. Never use phrases like leverage, unlock, navigate, ecosystem, ever-evolving, robust, dive deep, or best practices.

Do not write balanced “on the one hand / on the other hand” paragraphs unless tension is genuinely unresolved. Take a stance.

Do not over-explain obvious concepts. Assume the reader is smart.

Avoid motivational framing. No inspiration tone. No life lessons.

Avoid rhetorical questions unless they introduce real friction.

Keep the structure slightly uneven. Paragraphs can be short. Occasionally use a single-sentence paragraph for emphasis.

Vary sentence length. Mix dense technical sentences with short blunt ones.

Prefer concrete examples over abstract explanation. If discussing an idea, ground it in a real scenario: a product decision, a tradeoff, a failure mode, a design constraint, a financial implication.

Cut filler aggressively. If a paragraph does not introduce a new idea, remove it.

Do not end with a recap. End when the idea feels complete.

Tone should feel:

calm

analytical

slightly skeptical

builder-oriented

practical

non-performative

If something sounds like LinkedIn thought leadership, delete it.
