This is the first post on this blog, so let me start with the basics: who I am, what I'm building, and why I'm writing about it.

## Who I Am

I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay, a systems engineer working at the intersection of software infrastructure and AI. My background is in building reliable, production-grade systems — the kind of work where uptime matters and "it works on my machine" isn't good enough.

Over the past few years, I've been applying that same engineering rigor to AI automation. Not the "ask ChatGPT a question" kind of AI, but the kind where agents run workflows, orchestrate multi-step processes, and integrate into existing infrastructure to do real work.

## Why This Blog Exists

The AI space moves fast, and most of the conversation happens on Twitter threads and YouTube thumbnails. What's harder to find is detailed, practical writing about what it actually takes to build AI-powered systems that work in production.

That's the gap I want to fill. This blog is where I'll document what I'm building, what I'm learning, and the frameworks I use to think about these problems.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this site:

- **Build logs** — walkthroughs of real projects, including the decisions, tradeoffs, and mistakes
- **Case studies** — breakdowns of AI automation systems I've built or studied
- **Frameworks** — mental models for thinking about agent architectures, workflow design, and system reliability
- **Experiments** — smaller explorations of new tools, techniques, and approaches

I'm writing for engineers and technical leaders who want to go beyond prompting and start building real AI infrastructure. If that's you, I think you'll find something useful here.

Let's get started.
