I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay. I've been a software engineer for over ten years, mostly working on securing and productionizing distributed systems, container platforms, and cloud infrastructure. Honestly, it was starting to feel like a grind. Then agentic AI came along and suddenly it feels like I have a renewed passion for software engineering.

I'm spending most of my free time experimenting with AI-assisted development right now. It just fits how I've always thought about building software: get something working, put it in front of people, and iterate from there. The less time between "I have an idea" and "here's a thing you can use," the better. AI collapses that gap in a way nothing else has.

I've gone through phases already. The agent roleplay orchestrator hype train. Cranking out personal apps. Now I'm building Claude into a personal assistant that can search my email, manage my tasks, and handle real errands. Each experiment teaches me something new about where this stuff actually works and where it falls apart.

## What this site is

This is where I share those experiments. What I'm building, what I'm learning, what surprised me. The goal is to document the real experience of working with agentic AI, not the polished version.

## Why I care

I think agentic AI is going to follow a path similar to the internet. There are early adopters now, but there are plenty of skeptics even still. Over the next decade or two, businesses and individuals will gradually adopt agentic workflows, and there will be a long tail of people who need help understanding and transitioning to these tools. I want to be early and I want to be deep in it, so that when that wave comes, I'm ready to help.
