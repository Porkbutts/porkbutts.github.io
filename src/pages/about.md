I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay, a systems engineer focused on AI automation. I build agent-driven workflows, developer tools, and production infrastructure that put AI to work on real problems — not just demos and prototypes.

## What I Do

My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and AI operations. I design and build systems where AI agents handle meaningful work: automating workflows, orchestrating multi-step processes, and integrating into existing infrastructure.

**Focus areas:**

- **Agentic systems** — designing AI agents that operate reliably in production environments
- **Workflow automation** — building pipelines that connect AI capabilities to real business processes
- **Developer tooling** — creating tools that make AI-assisted development practical and repeatable
- **Systems infrastructure** — deploying and operating AI workloads at the platform level

## What This Site Covers

This blog is where I write about the engineering side of AI automation. Expect build logs, architectural breakdowns, framework comparisons, and lessons learned from putting these systems into production.

I write for engineers and technical leaders who want to move beyond prompt engineering into building real AI-powered infrastructure.
