I'm Adrian Teng-Amnuay, a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in production infrastructure, cloud systems, and security. Service meshes across hundreds of Kubernetes clusters, zero-trust auth systems, container platforms at scale, AI-powered developer tools. The common thread has always been taking complex operational problems and building reliable systems around them.

These days I'm deep into agentic AI. I'm building tools, prototypes, and production-grade systems that use AI agents to solve real problems. Not just prompting, but the orchestration, failure handling, state management, and integration work that makes agents useful in practice.

## What this site is

This is where I share what I'm building and what I'm learning along the way. I work primarily with Claude Code, and this site is where I document the experiments: what I built, how it works, and how you can do it too. I'm building up a portfolio of agentic software and documenting the engineering decisions behind it.

The goal is straightforward: demonstrate that I can build these systems well, and connect with people who need them built.

## Work with me

If you're a founder, team, or business looking to build AI-powered automation, I'd like to hear from you. I bring infrastructure-grade engineering to agentic systems, and I'm interested in projects where reliability and real-world integration matter more than demos.
